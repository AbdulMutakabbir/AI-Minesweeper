# AI-Minesweeper
Building an AI to solve minesweeper using Propositional Logic. The project has an GUI to play the game.

# Introduction
Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.” Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a “safe” cell reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.

Using rules from the game and applying the Propositional Logic to represent these rules, the AI should determine a space cell and pick them while making the unsafe cells.
